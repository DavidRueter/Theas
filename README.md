# Theas

Theas is a server-side web application framework that provides:

1) turnkey performance and security-aware embedded web server (written in Python 3.4, based on Tornado)
2) extensions to Jinja2 templating via custom filters
3) session management
4) session data management and multi-tier data binding
5) database-only content and templates (no filesystem used)
6) mechanism for using template-specific stored procedure to retrieve and update data
7) support for both normal POST / GET requests and async / AJAX request
... and more.

Theas does not impose any restrictions on client-side development:  you are free to use whatever tools and frameworks you like.

See thie Wiki for more information.

This project is actively maintained as of 5/16/2018.  It was created on 4/8/2016.  I have not yet created a sample stand-alone database for Theas, as I have been using Theas with OpsStream (a MSSQL application from http://opsstream.com).

I am happy to help you get your dev environment set up, and to help you get your Theas server working--either with OpsStream or some other database of your choosing.  Let me know if you have questions or if I can be of assistance.
