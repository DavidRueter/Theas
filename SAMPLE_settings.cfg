# This file contains settings used by the Theas web server application.
# Settings can also be passed in as command-line parameters.
# Settings passed in as command-line parameters override the settings in the settings file.

# If for some reason you want Theas to use a different directory for
# files it needs (such as Theas.js, etc.), you can specify that path here.
# The default is to use the same directory where this settings.cfg file
# is located, which in turn defaults to the directory where the .EXE file
# is located:
# settings_path=C:\Theas\files
